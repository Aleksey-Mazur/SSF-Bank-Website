# SSF-Bank-Website
Responsive banking page layout with lots of dynamic effects. Created using Gulp and SCSS. All site dynamics and behavior was created with vanilla JS (no additional libraries).<br/>
Effects that have been implemented with JS in this project:<br/>
- Menu-Burger;
- Modal window;
- Smooth scrolling (navigation and "Learn More" button);
- Tabbed component;
- Menu fade animation (change sibling elements opacity while hover a link in header navigation);
- Sticky navigation (created using Intersection Observer API to improve page perfomance as opposed to using scroll event);
- Revealing elements on scroll;
- Lazy loading images;
- Slider (can be controlled with arrow-buttons, dots, swipe on mobile).<br/>
